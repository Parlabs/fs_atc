# Flight Simulator Sounds Enhanced

FS Sounds E is a free and open source tool for any flight simulator (xplane,p3d, mfs2020) made to enhance the simulator's audio. You can use it to simulate the Sounds in the cockpit that a passenger boarding would make or simulate the air traffic control using speech recognition.
